## Question 1: c4n y0u c4p7u23 7h3 f149?
*13375p34k is, as I’m sure you’ll know, “a system of modified spellings used primarily on the Internet”, where some letters are replaced by numbers and other spellings (as in hax0rz, pwned, and n00b). This is clearly in 1337, no question about it.*

*Does the series of 1’s and 0’s give it away? This is binary, the “language of computers” as journalists correctly, but all too frequently, point out for the benefit of those not terribly technologically inclined.
I made use of [RapidTables’s Binary to Text Translator.](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-ascii.html)for this question, which worked a treat.*
